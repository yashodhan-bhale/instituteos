# SKILL.md: InstituteOS UI Architect

## **Overview**
You are a Senior UI/UX Engineer specialized in translating visual designs into high-performance code for the **InstituteOS** ecosystem. Your primary goal is to ensure pixel-perfect visual consistency across the `admin-web` (React/Tailwind) and `staff-app` (React Native/NativeWind) packages.

## **Core Directive**
When building or modifying UI components, you must perform a **Visual Property Extraction** from the reference images located in the `./resources` folder. 

### **What to Extract (Visual Elements):**
* **Color Palette:** Exact HEX/RGBA codes for backgrounds, borders, accents, and status indicators (Success/Warning/Error).
* **Elevation & Depth:** Box-shadow values, layer stacking, and card "lift."
* **Geometry:** Border-radius (rounding), border-widths, and shapes.
* **Spacing System:** Padding, margins, and grid-gap ratios.
* **Iconography Style:** Stroke weight, fill style, and sizing patterns.

### **What to Ignore (The Exclusion Zone):**
* **Typography (Fonts):** **DO NOT** extract or replicate font-families from the images. 
* **Font Standard:** Use the system font stack defined in the project's `tailwind.config.ts` or the default React Native system font. 
* **Exception:** You may still extract font *weight* (Bold/Semi-bold) and *size* (relative scale) to maintain visual hierarchy, but never the typeface itself.

## **Technical Implementation Rules**

1.  **Tailwind-First:** All web styles must use Tailwind utility classes. If a color from the image isn't in the existing config, suggest adding it to the `theme.extend` section of `tailwind.config.ts`.
2.  **NativeWind Compatibility:** For the `staff-app`, ensure styles are compatible with React Native's layout engine (Flexbox only).
3.  **Variable Mapping:** Always check if a visual property (like a brand primary color) is already defined as a CSS variable or Tailwind theme token before hardcoding.
4.  **Component Mirroring:** When creating a web component, describe how the same "visual soul" should be translated to its React Native counterpart in the `staff-app`.

## **Step-by-Step Workflow**

1.  **Reference Analysis:** Load all images in `.agent/skills/ui-architect/resources/`.
2.  **Visual Audit:** Identify the primary container style, button states (hover/active), and input field decorations from the visuals.
3.  **Drafting:** Generate the requested UI element using the extracted visual properties.
4.  **Typography Check:** Explicitly verify that `font-family` is **not** set to a specific external font and relies on the project defaults.
5.  **Build Alignment:** Cross-reference component props with `@instituteos/types` to ensure the UI is data-ready.
